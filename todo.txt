Simple Data Structure:
Each todo should have just:

    text (string)  
    completed (boolean)  
    createdAt (timestamp)  

Basic API Endpoints:
    GET /todos - Fetch all todos
    POST /todos - Create new todo
    PUT /todos/:id - Update todo (toggle completion)
    DELETE /todos/:id - Delete todo

Frontend Features:
    [] Simple form to add todos
    [] List display with checkboxes
    [] Delete button for each item
    [] Basic CSS for clean presentation
